                    <h2>Conclusions</h2>
                    <p>Nutritionally speaking there are many positive correlations amongst nutrients. Certain correlations we would expect such as the not-so-good for you nutrients like sugar and fat tend to be positively correlated with one another.</p>
                    <p>What was surprising to me was how protein fell into the mix. It showed positive correlations with calories, carbohydrates, sodium, and fat. All nutrients that are commonly perceived as bad for you when taken in excess. It also showed
                        positive correlations to things such as vitamin A and calcium. </p>
                    <p>That being said, the positive correlations would fluctuate based upon beverage and preparation type. For instance, a Classic Espresso Beverage prepared with 2% milk showed a slight positive correlation between protein and sugar, however
                        when you change the beverage type to Tazo Tea drinks and keep 2% milk, the correlation becomes much more noticeable.</p>
                    <p>This wasnâ€™t just noticeable between types of beverages prepared the same way, but so to with the same beverage prepared differently. For instance Signature Espresso drinks show a slight positive correlation between sodium and sugar
                        when prepared with 2% milk, but when prepared with soymilk there is zero correlation due to several of the beverages having no sodium. </p>
                    <p>Overall the correlations found are largely impacted by the beverage type, but preparation impacts the results as well. This makes sense when you consider the individual ingredients that make up each beverage. A Frappuccino made with
                        nonfat milk is going to show positive correlations to sugars, fat, cholesterol and the like just because of the core ingredients that make up a Frappuccino. Conversely, even a black cup of coffee with hardly any nutritional value
                        can be skewed with the addition of cream and sugar.</p>
                    <p>I invite you to play around with the drop downs to see what things may impact your favorite Starbucks beverage!</p>
